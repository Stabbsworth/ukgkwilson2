Greetings, if you find this file, then I am Wilson P. Higgsbury, independent scientist.

I appear to have been sent to your computer as some sort of... ukagaka? I believe that's what the name of it is. I'm not sure if this is some form of mistake or an invention that I made and forgot about.

Either way, I am from Earth and was taken from Earth into the Constant. I hope this may be some form of reprieve.

==================

This UKAGAKA primarily works with SSP and uses YAYA. The developer has not tested this ukagaka with any other baseware, and things may break if used with other basewares or ported to other programming languages (including YAYA's predecessor, AYA5).

Included are functions for a changelog, an update system, a hunger system, and other basic ukagaka functions. Wilson has the capability to be both annoyed and tired, and this will slowly be expanded with updates.
